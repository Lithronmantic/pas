Based on machine vision, we developed a deep learning-based pest analysis system. We are very grateful to the original authors of YOLOv5 for their significant contributions! We will disclose our full code upon acceptance of the paper. (The mathematical modeling used in the pest analysis system will be continuously updated with our subsequent investigations.)
If any researcher can provide specific information about rice pests in different regions, please contact the corresponding author. We will appreciate it in our subsequent research!
